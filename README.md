# Iridium
**Iridium** is an advanced code analysis tool designed to measure and minimize structural distance between codebases.
It helps developers, educators, and code reviewers by analysing how similar codebases are.

By leveraging static analysis, parse trees (PTs), and pattern recognition technique, **Iridium** provides
**helpful refactoring suggestions** to align codebases more closely or to highlight significant divergences. This makes
it particularly useful for:
- **Plagiarism or collusion** in academic environments
- **AI-generated or unoriginal code** that may be copy-pasted or generated by an AI agent
- **Redundant code** that may produce unused compilation artifacts
- **Code transposition** for duplicate logic that can be *transposed* into methods/functions
